# MusoMP3

IDE : Delphi 7
requires Rasie Components 4 to be installed.

I created this app so I could practise parts of songs that were a challenge.

The App basically interfaces with Winamp.  You set a start time and a finish time and the period will replay 
so you can practise the part as you like.

Needed to get some code for controlling Winamp and some other code to read the metadata from the MP3 files. (thanks to those guys for uploading their code).

I later thought about creating an interface design similar to the cool interfaces in movies like Avatar, Star Trek and the likes.

2 weeks of working on it and finaly got something similar.
