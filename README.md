# MusoMP3

IDE : Delphi 7
requires Rasie Components 4 to be installed.

I created this app so I could prctise parts of songs that were chanllenging.

The App basically interfaces with Winamp.  You set a start time and a finish time and the period will replay 
so you can practise the part as you like.

I later thought about creating an interface design similar to the cool interfaces in movies like Avatar, Star Trek and the likes.

2 weeks of working on it and finaly got something similar but happy with it.
